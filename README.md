=========

You'll need a database to complete this assignment. MySQL is a good free option, but feel free to be creative.

Some suggestions:
MAMP (Mac, Apache, MySql, PHP) - http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/index.html
WAMP (Windows ...) - http://www.wampserver.com/en/

For Linux users, you probably already have some of these components, but Apache, MySQL, PHP are all great options still.
